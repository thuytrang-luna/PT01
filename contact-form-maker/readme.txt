= How can I create website forms with Contact Form Maker? =

Navigate to **Contact Form Maker > Forms** page to build your very first form. This contact form creator plugin provides a few sample forms, which you can quickly edit and publish.

Using **Contact Form Maker > Forms** page, you can manage existing forms, perform **Bulk Actions,** such as **Publish, Unpublish, Duplicate** or **Delete.** Select the necessary form, choose the bulk action, then press **Apply.** Also, you can search for your form by writing its title in the top **Search** input.

Press **Add New** button from **Forms** page, and you will be redirected to **Form Editor** page. Make sure to write a **Title** for this form, then choose the **Theme** which sets the appearance of your form. In case you wish to display the form with the same style as your website theme, select **Inherit From Website Theme** option from **Theme** select box.

To add a new field with this application form creator, drag **New Field** button to the area where you wish to place the field. The field editor toolbox of Contact Form Maker will be opened automatically. Click on the field set from which you are going to choose the form field, for instance, **User Info Fields.** Press **Name** button from this field set to add a Name input to your form. Then click **Add** and the field will be placed to the area of the form you selected initially.

It is also possible to search among the form builder fields when adding a new field to your form. Use **Filter** input at the top left corner of fields toolbox. For example, you can search "phone" and all Phone fields will be filtered.

= Can I add a custom header with text and image above my form? =

This dynamic form builder lets you have a nice header section on your forms, which can contain additional content, as well as images with animations. Click on **Form Header** bar of your form to open its toolbox and provide a **Title.** This is the form heading, which will appear above your form. In addition, you can write a **Description** to appear right below the Title of your form. This comes handy, in case you need to write an introduction for your form.

You can also have an image on your form header and set it to appear with an animation effect. Press **Add Image** button to upload and select a picture from **WordPress Media Library.** Then choose the animation effect using Image Animation option.

In case you don't want the **Header Image** of your forms to appear on smartphones and tablets, mark **Hide Image on Mobile** option as checked.

Make sure to **Publish/Update** the form to save the change you made.

= Does Contact Form Maker support conditional logic and how can I use it? =

Yes, another fantastic feature of this custom form creator plugin is its **Conditional Fields.** This lets you **show** or **hide** fields of your form based on certain selections submitter makes.

The structure of conditional fields in this contact form generator is the following: You can specify and/or show/hide a field, when condition is true and provide conditions below, e.g. Show "How many visitors will you have" if "Will you have visitors" is "Yes".

Go to **Form Options** of your form, then click **Conditional Fields** tab to start the setup. Press **Add Condition** button to configure the first condition of your form.

**Show/Hide** select box of this form builder plugin represents the action which will be completed, if all or any of the condition statements are fulfilled. Use the second drop-down menu to select the advanced form builder field which will be shown or hidden.

Click the little **Plus (+)** icon to add the statement of your form condition.

For example, let's assume there is a **Single Line Text** field on your form titled **Inquiry type.** And you wish to show **Message** field in case users write **Support Request** as the type of their inquiry. The condition you configure needs to have the following logic:

*Show [Message] if [all] of the following match:*
*[Inquiry type] is [Support request]*

Make sure to hit **Update** after setting up Conditional Fields on your Contact Form Maker.

= What styling options do the forms include? =

This secure form builder plugin comes with **14 customizable themes,** which you can use to design your forms. Each theme of Contact Form Maker provides a set of user-friendly options to change font size, alignment of the form, colors, modify paddings and more. You can edit the existing themes, or create your own by clicking **Add New** button.

To set a initial default theme for your forms, press on the star icon next to the theme you would like to use. You can always change the theme by editing your forms.

Options of Contact Form Maker Themes are divided into the following sections:

  * Global Parameters
  * Header
  * Content
  * Inputbox
  * Choices (Multiple and Single)
  * General Buttons
  * Pagination
  * Buttons
  * Close (Minimize) Button
  * Minimize Text
  * Other
  * Custom CSS

You can preview the design of each form theme under Preview block. In case you created forms with multiple pages, you can change its Pagination Type, setting it to Step, Percentage or None.

Custom CSS option in Themes of this advanced form builder lets you write additional CSS code and customize your forms further. All CSS rules apply to this editor. Make sure to press Save after modifying the form theme.

= Does Contact Form Maker use auto-respondent feature? =

You can use **Email Options** of Contact Form Maker to send a fully customizable letter to the submitter. The entries can be included within the email. Just select the form you want to edit, then navigate to **Form Options &gt; Email Options.**

This html5 form builder plugin lets you send submitted information to one or multiple email addresses. Furthermore, you can also send a confirmation email to the submitter and let them know you have received their application.

Enable Send E-mail from **Form Options &gt; Email Options** tab and start configuring mailing settings. Most options require the same configuration for Email to Administrator and Email to User on the forms. However, there are a few settings which are unique.

**Email to Administrator**

This section of Email Options allows you to set up notifications of form submissions for website owners.

**Email to User**

**Send to.** Use this setting to select the email field of your form, to which the submissions will be sent.
